# Fixes Applied

## 1. Model Configuration ✅

Changed OpenAI model from `gpt-4o` to `gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07` in:
- `Sources/AgentS3Swift/CLI/CLIRunner.swift` (both generation and grounding models)

## 2. Hotkey Execution Fixed ✅

### Critical Bug Fixed:
**Problem**: `CGEventExecutor.hotkey()` was only pressing modifier keys (like Command) but **never actually pressing the regular keys** (like Space). So `hotkey(["command", "space"])` would only press/release Command, never Space!

**Solution**: 
- Separated modifiers from regular keys
- Press all modifiers down
- Press all regular keys down  
- Release regular keys first
- Release modifiers last

### Command Execution Fixed:
**Problem**: `executeActionCode()` in `Grounding.swift` was missing handlers for:
- `HOTKEY()` commands - completely ignored!
- `BACKSPACE()` - not handled
- `PRESS_ENTER()` - not handled
- `CLIPBOARD_SET()` - not handled
- `WAIT(time)` with parameter - only handled `WAIT` without time

**Solution**:
- Added `executeHotkeyCode()` to parse and execute HOTKEY commands
- Added `executeClipboardSetCode()` for clipboard operations
- Added `executeWaitCode()` to parse WAIT(time) with seconds
- Added handlers for BACKSPACE() and PRESS_ENTER()
- Made `executeActionCode()` parse **semicolon-separated command sequences**

### CLIRunner Fixed:
**Problem**: CLIRunner wasn't actually calling `executeActionCode()` - it had placeholder code that didn't execute anything.

**Solution**: Now properly calls `agent.groundingAgent.executeActionCode(actionCode)`

### New CGEventExecutor Methods:
- `pressEnter()` - Presses Enter/Return key
- `pressBackspace()` - Presses Backspace/Delete key  
- `setClipboard(_ text:)` - Sets clipboard content

### Key Code Mapping Enhanced:
- Added proper key code mapping for special keys: space, enter, tab, backspace, escape, arrows
- Added letter key mappings (a-z) with correct macOS virtual key codes
- Made key matching case-insensitive

## 3. Python Code Check ✅

**Result**: No executable Python code found in `swift_agent/` folder.

**Note**: `ProceduralMemory.swift` contains Python-style function signatures (e.g., `def click(...)`) but these are **intentional documentation strings** shown to the LLM in system prompts. They are NOT executable Python code - they're just Swift strings that document the available actions.

Example:
```swift
proceduralMemory += """
def hotkey(keys: List):
    '''Press a hotkey combination...'''
"""
```

This is expected and correct - the LLM needs to know what actions are available, so we show it Python-style function signatures even though the actual execution is in Swift.

## 4. Build Status ✅

All code compiles successfully. Ready to test!

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Command+Space**: Should now properly open Spotlight
   ```
   ./run.sh "Open Spotlight and type 'calculator'"
   ```

2. **Test Clipboard**: Should set clipboard and paste
   ```
   ./run.sh "Select all text in TextEdit and copy it"
   ```

3. **Test Command sequences**: Should execute multiple commands
   ```
   ./run.sh "Press Command+C then wait 1 second"
   ```

## Known Limitations

1. **Key Code Mapping**: Currently only handles ASCII letters and common special keys. For full keyboard support, would need a complete macOS virtual key code mapping.

2. **Character Typing**: `getKeyCode(for: Character)` uses a simplified ASCII mapping. For proper keyboard layout support, would need to use macOS keyboard layout APIs.

3. **Unicode Text**: Unicode text is handled via clipboard (Command+C/Command+V), which is correct but slower than direct typing for ASCII.

All fixes maintain the existing structure and goal of replacing Python `eval()` with structured Swift enum-based action execution.
